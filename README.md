# MonkeyPoxPATIENTS-Dataset-EDA-MachineLearning

### Introduction

- An ongoing outbreak of monkeypox, a viral disease, was confirmed in May 2022. The initial cluster of cases was found in the United Kingdom, where the first case was detected in London on 6 May 2022 in a patient with a recent travel history from Nigeria.

### Objective:

- Our Main Objective is that the dataset currently contains boolean and categorical features and in future, we might add more data and features to help you identify the patients of Monkey-Pox.     

### Tools:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib 
- Seaborn
- Sklearn

### Conclusion:

- We can able to achieve our objective by using decision tree classifier machine learning algorithm.
